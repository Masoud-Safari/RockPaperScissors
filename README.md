# RockPaperScissors: A Classic Game Reimagined

## Introduction

RockPaperScissors, a project developed through my Hacking with Swift course journey, reimagines the classic hand game in a digital format. This app was designed to further my understanding of SwiftUI and its interaction patterns, making learning both fun and interactive.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** This version of the RockPaperScissors game introduces an engaging twist to the classic gameplay. At the start of each round, the app randomly selects one of the three classic options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to represent the computer's move. Simultaneously, it randomly assigns the player a goal: to win or to lose the round based on the computer's choice. The player must then select the option that achieves the given goal against the computer's move. This unique approach requires players to think strategically, not just about what beats what, but also about how to intentionally win or lose based on the computer's selection and the assigned goal.
- **Technologies Used:** This app utilizes SwiftUI for its user interface, embracing a declarative syntax that integrates seamlessly with the rest of the iOS ecosystem. The logic for the computer's choice and determining the winner is implemented in Swift.

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The goal was to create a simple yet engaging application that would allow me to practice basic SwiftUI concepts, including state management, user input handling, and integrating logic into a SwiftUI app.
- **Skills Gained:** Through this project, I deepened my understanding of the SwiftUI framework, improved my Swift programming skills, and learned how to create interactive and user-friendly apps. It also honed my ability to think logically and implement game mechanics effectively.
